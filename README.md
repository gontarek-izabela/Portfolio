# About me
My name is Izabela Gontarek. I've graduated Gdansk University of Technology in 2010 (Civil Engineering). Somewhere around 2013 I've become interesed in project management and ways of succesfully getting things done. In 2014 I've finished post-gradute studies in project management of Warsaw School of Economics. I've gained the PRINCE2 Foundation certificate in 2016, PMP certificate in 2018 and Professional Scrum Master I certificate in 2021. Project Management is still my great passion but after giving birth to my second child I've felt a great surge of power and decided to change my career after years of working as a project manager. I was always obsessed with quality so testing seemed extremelty exciting and felt closely related to my natural strengths: being a perfectionist with great attention to details, always determined to figure out how things work / why something does not work / how to make things work better and faster.
